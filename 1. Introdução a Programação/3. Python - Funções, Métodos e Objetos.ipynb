They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n","\n","On a more fundamental level, functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again. If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n","\n","Functions will be one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design (we will dive much deeper into the ideas of design when we learn about Object Oriented Programming)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TfEHCzZVieuL"},"source":["### Why even use functions?\n","\n","Put simply, you should use functions when you plan on using a block of code multiple times.
