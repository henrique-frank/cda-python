Calma, estarei contigo!!**\n","\n","O inglês desempenha um papel fundamental no mundo da programação por várias razões:\n","\n","1. **Padrão da Indústria**: A maioria das documentações, fóruns, tutoriais e recursos relacionados à programação estão em inglês. Isso torna o inglês a língua franca da programação e é essencial para acessar e aproveitar esses recursos.\n","\n","2. **Comunicação Global**: A programação é frequentemente um esforço colaborativo que envolve desenvolvedores de todo o mundo. O inglês é a língua comum usada para comunicação entre equipes globais de desenvolvimento de software.\n","\n","3. **Nomenclatura**: Muitos termos técnicos, palavras-chave e bibliotecas em programação são em inglês. Usar esses termos em seu idioma original ajuda a evitar confusões e erros.\n","\n","4. **Manutenção e Leitura de Código**: Mesmo que você esteja escrevendo código para uso pessoal, outras pessoas podem precisar lê-lo ou mantê-lo. Escrever em inglês torna o código mais acessível e compreensível para um público mais amplo.\n","\n","\n","### OBS: Se você sentir muita dificuldade, me mande uma mensagem no instagram que eu gero um código desse em português, mas eu considero essencial você tentar!

Open a new window with **[the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**, and click on the **\"Join Competition\"** button, if you haven't already.

He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic.\n","\n","### (2) test.csv\n","\n","Using the patterns you find in **train.csv**, you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in **test.csv**) survived.  \n","\n","Click on **test.csv** (on the left of the screen) to examine its contents.
